                I was born in Oregon, but went to primary and secondary school in Southern California. Every summer I returned to visit my relatives
                in Portland, Oregon. Due to my love of nature found from the Pacific Northwest, I started my post-secondary school education with a
                <strong>Bachelors of Science in Biological Sciences</strong> from the <em>University of California at Irvine</em>. I excelled at
                organic chemistry, the class used as a filter to weed out students who couldn't handle the academic rigor. The focus of the content
                was about explaining why chemical reactions happen the way they do based on the functional parts of chemical compounds. I found this
                topic highly engaging, whereas the standard Biology courses were emphasizing memorization of long chains of chemical reactions without
                much care for the reasons. I ended up frequently tutoring my peers in my study group, because I was able to explain the reasonings of
                concepts clearly and precisely in way that facilitates understanding rather than rote memorization.

                After graduating, I took a year off by teaching English abroad at a public school in South Korea. I found joy in helping people build
                knowledge. I decided to pursue being a certified teacher and attended the <em>University of California Los Angeles</em> for a
                <strong>Masters in Education</strong>. After finishing the program, I went back to South Korea, where I taught at middle school
                science at an international school in Seoul.
